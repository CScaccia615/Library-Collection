# Library-Collection
Project for The Odin Project demonstrating knowledge of JS Object Prototypes
<h2>Project Goals:</h2>
<p>Extend the ‘Book’ example from the previous lesson and turn it into a small Library app.</p>
<h2>Reflections:</h2>
<p>This project took multiple attempts to complete. I found myself needing to review my notes for each step of the project, this often led me to going back and redoing the previous step of the project. What is good about this project taking multiple attempts is that each time I revisited it, I found myself writing cleaner code, and cleaner notes / cleaner commits each time. For the final attempt at this project I started using a method taught early on in ToP curriculum, and that was how to ask technical questions, and while I never posted the technical questions in their discord, writing each of them out, helped me to isolate the problem, which then would lead me to breaking down exactly where I was stuck and helped me find the solution a lot quicker. My three main struggles of this project were as followed:</p> 
<ol>
<li>Getting the display to properly refresh each time a new book was added</li>
<li>Getting the delete button to properly delete the item in the array and not break the display</li>
<li>Getting the edit button to properly toggle the read status.</li>
</ol>
